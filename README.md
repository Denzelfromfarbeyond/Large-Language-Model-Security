README



This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of the security challenges associated with Large Language Models (LLMs) in web environments. From understanding the fundamentals of LLMs to mapping their API attack surface and proposing mitigation strategies, this project aims to raise awareness and provide insights into safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities.

Contents:

Introduction: Provides an overview of LLMs and highlights the significance of addressing security concerns in web environments.
Understanding LLMs: Explores the functionalities and vulnerabilities of LLMs, emphasizing the need for proactive security measures.
Detecting LLM Vulnerabilities: Discusses methodologies for identifying vulnerabilities in LLMs, including prompt engineering and analysis of API interactions.
LLM Workflow and Security Implications: Maps the workflow of LLM-API interactions and discusses the security implications for web environments.
Mapping LLM API Attack Surface: Examines the concept of "excessive agency," prompt injections, and various methods of injection attacks targeting LLMs.
Multistage Modal Injection: Explores the risks associated with multistage modal injection in LLMs and proposes mitigation strategies.
